# Simple Chat App

### Socket.IO

Install socket.io

```shell
npm install socket.io socket.io-client
```

Server

```typescript
import { Server } from "socket.io";

...

// socket.io
const io = new Server(server, { // create websocket endpoint so that server & client can talk to each other
  cors: {
      origin: "*",
      methods: ['GET', "POST"]
  }
}); 

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log(`user ${socket.id} is connected.`);

  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
      console.log(`user ${socket.id} left.`);
  });
});

```

Client

```javascript
import io from "socket.io-client";

...

created() {
    // initialize socket
    this.socketInstance = io("http://localhost:3000");
}
```


### Deploying the app using Heroku

Heroku is more flexible than Vercel. So if your team is trying to implement something that Vercel does not provide (e.g., WebSocket), then deploying with Heroku can be useful. 

### Getting the Student Offer
The student offer is only needed after Nov 28 when the free plan expires, but since it takes several days to get approval, we suggest you do it earlier.

**Step 1. Sign up for [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/pack_application)**
This might take 1~3 days for approval from GitHub.


**Step 2. Once you get approval from GitHub, apply for [Heroku Student Offer](https://www.heroku.com/github-students/signup)**
It takes up to 24 hours for the credits to be applied to your account.

### Deploying your website

**Step 3. Modify api/index.ts in your code**

Please modify your `api/index.ts` file as below. You can copy and paste these text!

```typescript=
// At the top
import path from "path";

…

// Add the following lines
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const vuePath = path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "client", isProduction ? "dist" : "public");
app.use(express.static(vuePath));
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(vuePath, "index.html"));
});

// Comment out the following lines
// app.all('*', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
//   res.status(404).json({
//     error: 'Page not found'
//   });
// });
```

**Step 4. [Create a new app](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) on Heroku**

Press the button “New” at the top right corner of the dashboard, and click on “Create a new app.” Name your app and choose US as the region.


**Step 5. Add a remote to your local repository**

Git remotes are versions of your repository that live on other servers. You deploy your app by pushing its code to a special Heroku-hosted remote that’s associated with your app. 

First, log in to Heroku.

```shell=
$ heroku login
```

Then add a remote using the following command.

```shell=
$ heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
```

**Step 6. Deploy your code**

First, change the NPM config mode. This makes sure that Heroku also installs devDependencies, not just dependencies in your `package.json`

```shell=
$ heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
```

Then you can use the following command to deploy your code

```shell
$ git push heroku main
```

Or if you want to deploy from a non-main branch of your local repository, use this command instead.

```shell
$ git push heroku branch-name:main
```

**Step 7. Go to the settings tab of your app, and set the config variables**
All the variables you had in your .env file should be updated here such as MONGO_SRV.

### Upgrading the dyno type

Go to the resources tab to change the dyno type. You don’t need to change the dyno type until Nov 28. But starting Nov 28, the free plan will no longer be available, so you need to upgrade it using your student offer.

To upgrade the plan, go to the resources tab and click on “change dyno type.” Then you will see a modal as below.

![modal](https://i.imgur.com/3hF7qDp.png)

You will receive credits worth $13 USD per month for 12 months (for a total value of $156 USD). This is enough to cover one month of the Eco Dynos plan ($5/month) or the Hobby Dynos plan ($7/month).
